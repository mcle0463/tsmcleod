            <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet!</p>
            While you are here, I'd like to begin by taking a moment to
            introduce myself. I am an Ontario based artist & designer, you can
            call me T. I've been an artist my whole life, or at least that's
            what my mom tells me, but my formal training started during a Design
            Foundations program at Humber College in 2010. The following year I
            took a few Interior Decorating courses at Conestoga College, before
            moving out west in 2012 to pursue a Textile Arts diploma at Capilano
            University. After moving back to Ontario, I discovered an interest
            in woodworking which led me to the Furniture and Cabinet Making
            program at Algonquin College that I completed in the summer of 2016.<br />
            <br />
            Here we are! Most of my free time is spent designing new prints and
            patterns with watercolour paints and line drawings, but I do tend to
            experiment with various media, from weaving to woodworking. My goal
            in creating an online presence is not only to produce high-quality
            prints and products, but also to find any and all artists that are
            looking to collaborate on joint projects. I think collaboration is a
            wonderful way for artists to grow and share as creators, and also to
            develop a local art scene in communities that might not otherwise be
            recognized for their hidden talent! <br />
            <br />My interests span various disciplines, so if you are an artist
            or creator (in the broadest sense of the term) reach out to me! If
            you've got an idea for a project, or even if you just want to chat,
            I'd love to hear from you.<br />
            <br /> I hope you find something you like and that you enjoy your
            visit. Come back anytime! <br />
            <br />Regards, â€‹<br />
            <br />T.<br />
